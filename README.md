A simple music player for those late nights.

 - [windows](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/njjnbg9a0sqn83nlcdtoa/moonlight-win32-x64.zip?rlkey=47qeactjc45mmh5ers3mkuzh6&st=a715t3ey&dl=1)

## why use moonlight?

 - offline*
 - listen to anything
 - directly search for and download songs and playlists from youtube 
 - sync your songs across devices

**of course, internet is required when syncing with cloud*

## you should know
When syncing your data, all of your files (`.mp3`, `.wav`, etc.) are sent to my server. *(my spare laptop)*

**I cannot snoop into the files you upload, even if I wanted to,** as they are encrypted prior to uploading. [more details](readme-resources/privacy.md)

So feel free to listen to [anything you want](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbOiYrMSPk) - I can't judge! :)
